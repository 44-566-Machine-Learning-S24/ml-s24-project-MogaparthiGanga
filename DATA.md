# Data Analysis

The data analysis has been performed in 4 stages and these analysis are visible on the following jupyter notebooks

* Notebooks with visualizations
    * [Linear Regression](linear_regression.ipynb)
    * [Clustering](clustering.ipynb)
* Other Notebooks
    * [Initial Exploration](initial_exploration.ipynb)
    * [Classification](classification.ipynb)
    

The exploration began with [Initial Exploration](initial_exploration.ipynb) which has been documented in the notebook. The data was pretty robust with 3323 Rows and 15 Columns. It consisted the Daily Data of bitcoin from 2007 to 2021. Some numeric Features of the data include the Prev Close, Open, High, Low, Last, Close, VWAP, Volume, Turnover, Trades, Deliverable Volume and %Deliverable and I figured that it would be pretty interesting to try to predict the close price of adaniport based on the open price.
